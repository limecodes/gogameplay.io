Visitor is already created when the page is rendered, so I need to pass the uuid to the React application
On Android, if the user changes their IP, then I need to update the visitor record with the UUID
The uuid is persisted in the local storage.
I can also have a flash for Android if the user is on wifi
        // For iPhone, I don't have access to the connection type so I can only tell by IP
        // I need to make sure that I don't call the IP2Location API more than I need to
        // User then chooses their carrier and proceeds to offer selection

        // TODO: Get the user's geo location by their IP address
        // On Android (network.connection)
        //  -> Check if the user if on wifi
        //      -> If the user is on wifi, ask the user to switch to cellular connection
        //      -> Onchange of network connection, update the IP and lookup the carrier
        // On iPhone
        //  -> Check the user's IP and check if mobile carrier values are there
        //  -> If they are not present, then ask the user to switch to cellular network
        //  -> Check if the IP address changed and do another lookup
        //  -> Have them select their carrier

        // UUID will persist, but IP address may change

        // In order to render the first page, I only need the geolocation to render the list
        // of carriers, I have two options:
        // 1. Trust the user to select their own carrier
        // 2. Do additional checks to ensure that the user is on a cellular connection

        // NEXT TODO:
        // 1. Echo the user IP address
        // 2. Setup React
        // 3. Echo the user's geolocation

        // To make the controller return 422
        // Later, will show a page with an error

        // BUG: Duplicate entry when trying to update if the user has been on the site before
        //      It's not grabbing the uid by previously used ip address
        //      The bug is in firstOrCreate, it's not grabbing a previous user by ip address
        //      This will eat up my API usage, I need to fix this to grab a previous user
        //      Without using firstOrCreate
        //      NO WAIT!!
        //      When a user comes in with wifi, then changes to cellular, it's not grabbing the user
        //      because it's not detecting their cellular IP, since I'm updating it.
        //      A fix would be to add another field or another record, instead of updating it.
        //      OR: I can add an ip_address-to-user_id table

        [x] TODO: Cleanup the game controller
        TODO: Fix up the front-end
        TODO: Offers ğŸ˜ˆ The fun part begins
        TODO: Don't forget non-mobile

        TODO: Beef up offers tests and do backups offers, focus on the offer part from now on.
        TODO: Back button redirect from offer

        TODO: Gotta change vagrant name and stuff to `gogameplay.local` since I'm combining the front page and not using S3

        // First I'm going to have offers that target a specific country and specific carrier
    // For Everything else, I'm going to have a redirect
    // Later, I'm going to have backup offers
    // Also, if user hits "back button" I need offers for an offer wall

    TODO: Complete test cases for offers

    1) It would be great if, instead of returning the name of the carrier as a string, return the database reference. I would have to record the carriers by country that IP2Location returns

    2) It would be great if, when a new carrier is found from IP2Location, it can automatically store it in the database.

    3) Serve the offers if a connection is detected where upon 'set' or on connection change
      

      TODO:

- Refactor some common stuff in visitorRepository to Visitor model
- See if there's a ngrok equivalent to php so that I can access my VM through mobile if outside the network
- Setup a staging environment that is always hooked to develop
- If I have a develop branch the merge workflow should be
    feature branch > develop > master
    always branch off of develop when develop is in-sync with master
- I also wanted to play around with navigator.connection (NetworkInformation) .prototype so that I can test and trigger certain events that aren't available to me (such as ontypechange)
- See if I can dispatch the event (onchange) through the browser console (*** This could be something I can put publicly in my github)
- ^ and see if I can have a snippet of code that is only added in 'dev' environment and not included in production so I don't have to remove it manually ... also could be a "helper" thing that I can publish in my giithub
- Might also want to get Olia's opinion as a test user.
- Would be good to add unit tests to test certain things in isolation.

Write a script that generates all instagram assets
- Write a script that generates the image for #1 and #3 items in grid
- Write a script that uses ffmpeg (the video cli) to generate the instagrame video for grid item #2
    - gameplays
    - blurry background
    - initial image
    ^ Compiles all these together in a 60 second video

Also remember to write down manual test cases with expected results, use a spreadsheet (Google Sheets)

Remember to host static files (js, css, images, etc...) in S3 because EC2 traffic is expensive (need to automate this process upon deploy)
